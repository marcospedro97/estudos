________________________________________________________

A perceptron is the base of machine learning, it's a basic
couple of mathematic tools that can adapt itself based in
the rightness of its assertions by changing the values in
its bias, in this case it was used to analise a simple 
linear regression, there's also a few articles that I've
used as reference for this implementation linked bellow.
