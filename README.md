A repo where I put my studies about algorithms,
Languages that I'm learning and frameworks I am studing
It's organized by languages, so if you're interessed in
only one of my skills you can just go to one folder and 
see my habilities in that especial language.

:D 

Have a good time, maybe it can help you with your own
studies!!
